Required Properties
#Name
{
  ...
  "name": "RAMA WORKS M6-A",
  ...
}
Copy
The name property denotes the name of the keyboard being defined.

#Vendor & Product ID
{
  ...
  "vendorId": "0x5241",
    "productId": "0x006a",
  ...
}
The productId property corresponds to the usb product id. This combined with the vendorId is what is used by VIA to identify the keyboard when it is plugged in.

#Lighting
{
  ...
  "lighting": "none",
  ...
}
The lighting property can either a preset: none, qmk_backlight, qmk_rgblight, qmk_backlight_rgblight, wt_rgb_backlight, wt_mono_backlight or for more advanced usage an object that extends one of those presets.

Use qmk_backlight if the firmware enables QMK's core backlight feature with BACKLIGHT_ENABLE=yes.

Use qmk_rgblight if the firmware enables QMK's core RGB Lighting feature with RGBLIGHT_ENABLE=yes.

Use qmk_backlight_rgblight if the firmware enables both.

Use of wt_rgb_backlight and wt_mono_backlight is for keyboards that use the lighting code in /keyboards/wilba_tech and not intended to be a generalized interface to other custom lighting implementations. A generalized interface is being developed. Keyboards that do not use QMK's core lighting implementations should wait for the generalized interface instead of implementing the current interface.

#Matrix
{
  ...
  "matrix": {
        "rows": 1,
        "cols": 6
    },
  ...
}
The matrix property defines how many rows and columns the PCB's switch matrix uses. This must match the MATRIX_ROWS and MATRIX_COLS symbols in the QMK firmware.

#Layouts
{
  ...
  "layouts": {
    ...
    "keymap": [
            [
                {
                    "c": "#505557",
                    "t": "#d9d7d7",
                    "a": 7
                },
                "0,0",
                "0,1",
                "0,2"
            ],
            [
                "0,3",
                "0,4",
                "0,5"
            ]
        ]
    ...
    }
  ...
}
The keymap property corresponds to the KLE json exported by KLE and has the switch row, col defined in the top-left legends and optionally the group number, option number defined in the bottom-right legends. The KLE can support up to 3 different colored keys which is used to identify the alpha, modifier and accent keys which VIA will automatically apply a theme to.
