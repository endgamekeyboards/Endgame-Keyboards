Optional Properties
#Lighting
{
  ...
  "lighting": {
    ...
    "extends": "none",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
The object must contain the extends key which contains one of the preset names and optionally can include following keys. The other keys defined in the object will override the properties defined in the preset. the-via/reader contains the defined values for each preset.

{
  ...
  "lighting": {
    ...
    "effects": [
      ["Solid Color 1", 1],
      ["Cycle All", 0]
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
The effects property is an array comprised of tuples that are made up of a string that is the effect label and the number of colors that the effect requires.

{
  ...
  "lighting": {
    ...
    "keycodes": "wt",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
The keycodes property can either be qmk or wt which controls what keycodes the keyboard uses to control the lighting. This maps to what is displayed in the keymap tab.

{
  ...
  "lighting": {
    ...
    "supportedBacklightValues": [
      10, // Effect
      11  // Effect Speed
    ]
    ...
  },
  ...
}
The supportedBacklightValues property is an array of all backlight commands supported by the keyboard. This defines what is shown in the Lighting tab for the user to control. An exhaustive list of values are defined in the the-via/reader package.

#Layouts
{
  ...
  "layouts": {
    ...
    "labels": [
      "Split Backspace",
      "ISO Enter",
      "Split Left Shift",
      "Split Right Shift",
      ["Bottom Row", "ANSI", "7U", "HHKB", "WKL"]
    ],
    ...
  }
  ...
}
The labels property is an optional array of string or string[] and defines the labels for the layout controls.

The order of the labels is important as the implicit index is used to map to the group number e.g. Split Backspace corresponds to layout option #0, ISO corresponds to layout option #1, etc.

If an item in the labels array is a string, it is presented as a toggle button, the off state maps to layout option choice #0 (the default), the on state maps to layout option choice #1.

If an item in the labels array is a string[], it maps to a select control with the first item in the array being used as the label for the control and the following items being used as labels of layout option choices #0, #1, #2, etc. In the example above, the Bottom Row is the label, ANSI maps to layout option choice #0, 7U maps to layout option choice #1, etc.
